## Introduction 

Huawei In-App Purchases provides 3 types of products: consumable, non-consumable and 
auto-renewable subscription. 

* Consumable : Consumables are used once, are depleted, and can be purchased again after being consumed.

* Non-consumable : Non-consumables can be only purchased once and do not expire. 

* Auto-renewable subscription : Once purchased, Users can access to value-added functions or content in a specified period of time. The subscriptions will automatically renew on a recurring basis until users decide to cancel.

This project implements the purchase process of consumable products, helping developers learn more about Huawei In-App Purchases.

## Configuration

To use the project package, you can configure a consumable in-app product in the AGC page referring to [configuring In-App Product Information](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/codelab/HMSInAppPurchase/index.html#4), and then apply the product in the project to finish the payment process.

3. When you finish payment, HUAWEI IAP will return the payment result to your app through onActivityResult. If success, the demo will call `consumeOwnedPurchase` API to notify Huawei IAP Service that user has consumed the purchase, and then the page will show you a tip "Pay success, and the product has been delivered".
